"Muslim Prayer Time BD" plugin provides the ability to display prayer (salat) times as well as Sehri and Iftar times for Muslims with pretty widget &amp; shortcode.


== Description == 
**Muslim Prayer Time BD** plugin gives the opportunity to show the schedule for prayers for the Muslim Ummah with a Pretty Widget. Moreover, the plugin also has the ability to display Sehri and Iftar times as well. Basically, the plugin is made by following the perpetual prayer calendar of Bangladesh. However, by adjusting the Prayer time and Sehri time, the schedule of Salat can be changed accordingly. Now, you can remind you and your blog's visitors about the importance of Salat or praying to Allah.

Using a pretty widget, you can display daily prayer timetable for your own place. In addition, in the month of Ramadan, you can also display Sehri and Iftar time by enabling Sehri &amp; Iftar time as well. Moreover, you can display as many widgets as you want by the facility of enabling or disabling Prayer and Sehri Time. As a result, if you want to display only Sehri card, you can do that by unmarking **Show Prayer Time** and vice-versa. Apart from this, you can set Prayer names, time format (12/24 hours, Am/PM), Sehri and Iftar card name, background color, font color, font weight and text align of the table.


== Instructions after upgrading to version 2.2 ==

<blockquote>
We have updated the plugin widget in version 2.2 to make the prayer timetable more professional. That is why, after updating to version 2.2, your prayer timetable widget will disappear. Therefore, we are requesting you to update your prayer timetable widget from **Appearance >> Widgets >> Muslim Prayer Time BD**. Once you set the widget again, prayer timetable widget will show again.
